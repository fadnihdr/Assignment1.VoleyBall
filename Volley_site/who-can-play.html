    <h2>Who Can Play</a>                  </h2>
    <p>	There are millions of  people all around the world who play volleyball at least once a week. Volleyball is a sport that is safe, fun and does not require extreme  fitness. Since you don&rsquo;t have to move around the court too fast, it&rsquo;s great for  people who want a low-impact sport that will help them get fit without pushing  them to their limit. </p>
    <p>For those who are a bit more competitive, the sport is  fantastic because games can be really exciting and intense, but there&rsquo;s always  a net between you and your opponents. <br>
      Beach volleyball is suitable for people of  all ages, and men and women alike.<br>
      Anyone considering starting a new sport or  exercise program should see a doctor first. </p>
